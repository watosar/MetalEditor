## Overview
This script prepares Pythonista for the handier coding of metal shaders.

## Usage
1. add `init_editor.py` to shortcut.
2. open shader file.
3. run the shortcut.
4. rerun it to reset Pythonista.

### Tips
- For syntax highlighting, I recommend naming shader files as `~~.js`.
- This script often crashes when you run it for the first time.
- The reload button is lazy. Please push him some times.
- *Donâ€™t change the tab*, the app certainly freeze.
